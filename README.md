## Dataset
Both the Word2vec and neural network are train on the famous [dataset](http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/) of movie reviews.

## Results
Already some satisfying are at the end of [model-evaluation.ipynb](https://github.com/janfiszer/next-word-predictor/blob/main/model-evaluation.ipynb).

More coming soon...
